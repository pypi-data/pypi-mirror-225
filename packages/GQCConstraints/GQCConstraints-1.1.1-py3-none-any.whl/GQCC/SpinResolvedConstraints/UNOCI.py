Spin Resolved Constraints - UNOCI
---------------------------------

This module is used for constraining spin-resolved operators in non-orthogonal configuration interaction calculations, carried out in a basis of unrestricted states. By setting up the constrained UNOCI object, the module prepares the basic functionalities to run constrained calculations for single values or to be used in one of the pre-set methods offered by GQCC.

# Import statements
import gqcpy
import numpy as np

from GQCC.Optimization.SpinResolvedOptimizer import SpinResolvedOptimizer


class UNOCI(SpinResolvedOptimizer):
    """
    A constructor that sets up everything needed for constrained NOCI calculations in an unrestricted basis.

    :param molecule:                    The GQCP molecule used for the calculations.
    :param electrons:                   The amount of alpha and beta electrons in the molecule as an array.
    :param SQ_basis:                    The second quantized GQCP basis set used for the calculations, defined for a molecule in a certain basis set. Make sure it is the same basis as in which the operator is defined.
    :param basis_state_vector:          A vector of non-orthogonal states that will serve as a basis for NOCI.
    :param operator:                    The GQCP operator that will be constrained.    
    :param constrained_observable:      The name of the observable being constrained.

    :returns:                           An object which contains all required data (basis, Hamiltonian,... ) and possesses the necessary methods to perform calculations.

    First we need to set up some basic variables with GQCP.

    .. code-block:: python

        H3 =  gqcpy.Molecule.HRingFromDistance(3, 1.88972, 0)   # The molecule.
        electrons = [2,1]                                       # The number of alpha and beta electrons.
        spinor_basis = gqcpy.USpinOrbitalBasis_d(H3, "STO-3G")  # The spin orbital basis.

    We also set up an operator (Mulliken in this case).

    .. code-block:: python

        S = spinor_basis.quantize(gqcpy.OverlapOperator())
        mulliken_domain = spinor_basis.mullikenDomain(lambda shell: shell.nucleus().position()[1] == 0 and shell.nucleus().position()[2] == 0)
        P = mulliken_domain.projectionMatrix(spinor_basis.expansion())
        mulliken_operator = S.partitioned(P)

    For UNOCI we need a vector of basis states consisting of unrestricted states, `basis_vector`. One way to generate such states is by running several constrained UHF calculations. 

    .. note:: 
    
        For info on generating states with constrained UHF see the `Constrained Hartree-Fock <https://gqcg-res.github.io/GQCConstraints/ConstrainedHartreeFock.html>`_ section or look at our `examples on github <https://github.com/GQCG-res/GQCConstraints/tree/develop/examples>`_.

    Once we have a everything, the constrained NOCI object can be created with GQCC.

    .. code-block:: python

        Constrained_object = GQCC.SpinResolvedConstraints.UNOCI(H3, electrons, spinor_basis, basis_vector, mulliken_operator, "population")
