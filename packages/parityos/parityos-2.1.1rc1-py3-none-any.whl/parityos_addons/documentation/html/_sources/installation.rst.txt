Installation
===================

ParityOS is a Python package; to install it you will need an environment with Python >= 3.7.

As ParityOS is hosted in a private package registry, you will need a
token in order to install it; contact ParityQC to receive one.

Once you do have a ParityOS token, please add the following lines to your pip.conf file (
typically located in a .pip directory in your home folder)::

    [global]
    extra-index-url = https://__token__:<parityos token>@gitlab.parityqc.com/api/v4/projects/55/packages/pypi/simple

where ``<parityos token>`` should be substituted by the token you received.

ParityOS can then be installed with pip::

    pip install parityos

This will install only the base features of ParityOS; in case one wants to use features related to
Cirq or Qiskit, one can install ParityOS via ``pip install 'parityos[cirq]'``
or ``pip install 'parityos[qiskit]'`` respectively.
For the ``spin_hamiltonian`` addon to be installed correctly, one has to add the `spinz` option to
the pip install specification: ``pip install 'parityos[spinz]'``
(or ``pip install 'parityos[spinz, cirq]'`` if one wants to install it together with Cirq).

.. note::
    Aside from adding the ``extra-index-url`` option in the ``pip.conf`` file,
    one can instead provide it when invoking pip, i.e.::

         pip install parityos --extra-index-url https://__token__:<parityos token>@gitlab.parityqc.com/api/v4/projects/55/packages/pypi/simple

.. note::
    It is recommended to install parityos inside a virtual environment.
    To create a standard Python ``venv`` environment, enter the following commands before
    installing parityos::

        python -m venv my_new_venv  && source my_new_venv/bin/activate

    To create a Conda environment, enter the following commands before installing parityos::

        conda create --name my_new_conda_env  &&  conda activate my_new_conda_env

    Remember to activate the environment each time you are going to use ``parityos``!
