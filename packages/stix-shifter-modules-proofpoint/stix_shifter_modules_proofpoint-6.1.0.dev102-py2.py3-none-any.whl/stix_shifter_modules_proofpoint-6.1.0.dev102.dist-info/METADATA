# stix-shifter-builder

This repo exists to pull in the stix-shifter project from its public repo and build it to deploy it to our private artifactory

Every commit will cause a build in travis and deploy whatever VERSION is set to in `scripts/travis-script.sh`. So update `VERSION` environment variables there and commit it in order to deploy a new build. 

### PLEASE NOTE:

If you just want to test your commit version replace the `TAG_VERSION` variable value with "" and set the `COMMIT_VERSION` variable value with commit number.
