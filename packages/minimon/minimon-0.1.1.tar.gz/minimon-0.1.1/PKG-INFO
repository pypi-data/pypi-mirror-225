# Minimon

This is just a stub for a future Readme file for minimon, the minimal monitor.

Here are some buzz-phrases:

- Minimal monitoring
- `textual`/`rich` based
- Heavy use of async programming
- `asyncssh` instead of `paramiko`
- Configuration as application
- Functional approaches wherever possible


## Installation

While you can just clone and use minimon, the intended way to use it is to install via
`pip` or run it from inside a virtual environment.

Install it locally using `pip`:

```sh
[<PYTHON> -m] pip[3] install [--user] [--upgrade] minimon
```


## Why

- async
- functional
- testability
- bullet proof


## Todo

This is very early development, no real todo-list here, yet. Some of the bigger tasks include

- [ ] provide a way to use data propagating through functions by different consumers
- [ ] provide broader set of useful data sources and handlers
- [ ] provide monadic (async) function chaining
- [ ] capture and persist metrics
- [ ] visualize metrics
- [ ] provide ways to interact
- [ ] improve logging: to file, log threads, log task context
- [ ] and error handling


## Development & Contribution

### Setup

For active development you need to have `poetry` and `pre-commit` installed

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user poetry pre-commit
git clone git@projects.om-office.de:frans/minimon.git
cd minimon
pre-commit install
# if you need a specific version of Python inside your dev environment
poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python3
poetry install
```


### Workflow

* Create/test/commit changes and check commits via `pre-commit`
* after work is done locally:
  - adapt version in `pyproject.toml`
  - build and check a package
```sh
poetry build && \
twine check dist/* &&
python3 -m pip uninstall -y minimon && \
python3 -m pip install --user dist/minimon-$(grep -E "^version.?=" pyproject.toml | cut -d '"' -f 2)-py3-none-any.whl
```
  - check installed package
  - go through review process
  - publish the new package `poetry publish --build`
  - commit new version && push
