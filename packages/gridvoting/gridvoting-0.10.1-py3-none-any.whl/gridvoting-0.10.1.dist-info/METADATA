# gridvoting

This software is a library module for our [research publication (open-access)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8):
<pre>
  Brewer, P., Juybari, J. & Moberly, R. 
  A comparison of zero- and minimal-intelligence agendas in majority-rule voting models.

</pre>

This software helps set up, calculate, and plot stationary probability distributions for
sequential voting simulations (with ZI or MI random challengers) that take place on a 2D grid of feasible outcomes.

In our paper, we used the simulations to show that adding intelligence to the agenda of a collection of voting bots does not necessarily
improve the fairness or reasonableness of outcomes.  We're not claiming adding intelligence is always bad, since one 
cannot deduce such generalities from a few simulations. But in some well-known scenarios, the simulations demonstrate cases where
adding intelligence to the voting agenda can increase the variance and decrease the equality of outcomes for equally situated agents.

## License

The software is provided under the standard [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). 

You are welcome to try the software, read it, copy it, adapt it to your
needs, and redistribute your adaptations. If you change the software, be sure to change the module name somehow so that
others know it is not the original.  See the LICENSE file for more details.  

## Disclaimers

The software is provided in the hope that it may be useful to others, but it is not a full featured turnkey
system for conducting arbitrary voting simulations. Additional coding is required to define a specific simulation.

Testing of the software is limited.  While there are some runtime assertion tests in the software, we do not include a fully automated test suite 
because our free testing provider does not include a GPU in the test environment.  

Some manual post-build testing has been done, but is not extensive.  

As with any code where extensive testing is not done, it may contain bugs, unexpected behaviors, or have other issues.

## code and data for specific simulations

Code specific to the spatial voting and budget voting portions of our research publication above -- as well as output data -- 
is deposited at: [OSF Dataset for A comparison of zero and minimal Intelligence agendas in majority rule voting models](https://osf.io/k2phe/)
and is freely available.

## use of Google Colab

We used [Google Colab](https://colab.google), a cloud-based service that runs Python-based analyses on Google's servers and GPUs,
for conducting most of the research reported in the publication above.  When using Google Colab, the local computer does NOT need to have a GPU.

The software has also run (without Colab) on a local computer with a Nvidia gaming GPU, and remote computers with industrial Nvidia A100 GPUs.

## requirements
* Nvidia GPU with minimum of 16GB GPU memory to duplicate simulations reported in the above paper
* Nvidia CUDA drivers (except on Google Colab, where CUDA is pre-installed)
* Python 3 
* **all** of these Python-3 scientific computing modules (all except cupy are pre-installed on Google Colab, and [cupy can be installed from these instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html)):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - cupy
* familiarity with Python language / scientific computing / gpu Nvidia-CUDA setup

## Random sequential voting simulations

This follows [section 2 of our research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8#Sec4)

A simulation consists of a sequence of times: `t=0,1,2,3,...`
a finite feasible set of alternatives **F**, a set of voters who have preferences over the alternatives and vote truthfully,
a rule for voting and selecting challengers, and a mapping of the set of alternativies **F** into a 2D grid.  

The active or status quo alternative at time t is called `f[t]`.  

At each t, there is a majority-rule vote between alternative `f[t]` and a challenger
alternative `c[t]`.  The winner of that vote becomes the next status quo `f[t+1]`.  

Randomness enters the simulation through two possible rules for choosing the challenger
`c[t]`.  When `zi=True`, `c[t]` is chosen from the "Zero Intelligence" agenda which consists
of a uniform random distribution over **F**.  When `zi=False`, `c[t]` is chosen from the 
"Minimal Intelligence" agenda which is a uniform distribution over the status quo `f[t]` and the possible
winning alternatives given the status quo `f[t]`.

## Principles of Operation 
This section extends a higher, more mathematical description from [section 3 of our research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-023-00387-8#Sec5).
with an overview of the code in the gridvoting module.

The gridvoting software module is designed to separate various concerns and manage the overlap of concepts.  

A primary concern is data transformation between different tasks.  The VotingModel and related Markov chain require a probabilistic vector space of dim number_of_alternatives.
Plotting occurs in a rectangular area.  The alternatives then also need to have coordinates within a rectangular area.  Utility functions for the 
alternatives might also depend on their coordinates.  If the alternatives' coordinates are not equivalent to a complete rectangular grid, then there needs to be
an embedding function from some smaller space into the rectangular area in order to communicate the results from the Markov chain calculation to the plotting routines
to the viewers' screen.  The Python3 `numpy` module creates arrays that are easy to reshape and manipulate, and is used intenally for many of the data transfomations.
Knowledge of how `numpy` can be used to manipulate data will be useful in writing additional code to further manipulate or analyze simulation data.
The `cupy` module is a drop-in replacement for `numpy` for accelerating data manipulation by using a hardware GPU.

The various concepts are coordinate grids, shapes within a grid, defining a voting simulation, and calculating the stationary distribution of the simulation
by a GPU-based MarkovChain calculation.  For example, one can have a voting simulation without a grid, or one can have a simulation where
the feasible alternatives are points within a triangle (from a budget constraint) itself embedded within a square grid for plotting purposes.

The `VotingModel` class manages simulations.  Each simulation is an instance of `VotingModel`.  The constructor
requires various properties of the simulation, such as the number of voters, number of alternatives, and voters' utility functions.
Utility functions are defined not as Python3 functions but as numeric arrays of dim `(number_of_voters, number_of_alternatives)` defining the 
utility of each voter for each outcome as a number where more is better. It is the ordering and not the values that are important.  
Besides plotting and answering simple questions about the alternatives, the class also provides code
for calculating the transition matrix and providing it as an input to the `MarkovChainGPU` class below.

The `Grid` class manages rectangular grids. An instance of `VotingModel` will usually specify
a Grid instance for defining utility functions and plotting/visualization purposes.  It is also possible to use `VotingModel`
without specifying any kind of grid or coordinate mapping, for an example see class `CondorcetCycle`.

The `MarkovChainGPU` class manages a Markov Chain calulation on a GPU.  This class is called 
internally from `VotingModel`.  The class contains two methods for calculating the 
stationary distribution of a Markov Chain: the power method (default), and an algebraic method
(optional).  

## Classes

### Grid

#### constructor

`gridvoting.Grid(x0, x1, xstep=1, y0, y1, ystep=1)`

Constructs a 2D grid in x and y dimenstions and provides helpful methods for accessing the grid.

- `x0` the leftmost grid x-coordinate
- `x1` the rightmost grid x-coordinate
- `xstep=1` optional, default value 1.  grid spacing in x dimenstion
- `y0` the lowest grid y-coordinate
- `y1` the highest grid y-coordinate
- `ystep=1` optional, default value 1.  grid spacing in y dimension

Example:  

```
import gridvoting
grid = gridVoting.Grid(x0=-5,x1=5,y0=-7,y=7)
```

Defines a grid where `-5<=x<=5` and `-7<=y<=7` 

This grid will have `11*15 = 165` alternatives corresponding to integer points in the grid.

Instance Properties:
* parameters from the constructor call are available as instance properties
  - grid.x0
  - grid.x1
  - grid.xstep
  - grid.y0
  - grid.y1
  - grid.ystep
* calculated properties
  - grid.x -- 1D numpy array containing the x-coordinate of each grid point in typewriter order
  - grid.y -- 1D numpy array containing the y-coordinate of each grid point in typewriter order
  - grid.gshape -- natural shape (number_of_rows,number_of_cols) where rows represent y-axis and cols represent x-axis
  - grid.extent -- equal to the tuple (x0,x1,y0,y1) for use with matplotlib.pyplot.plt
  - grid.len -- equal to the number of points on the grid

#### methods

`grid.as_xy_vectors()`

Returns a 2-D array of coordinates for each grid point in typewriter order

Example:

```
import gridvoting
grid = gridVoting.Grid(x0=-5,x1=5,y0=-7,y=7)
vectors = grid.as_xy_vectors()
print(vectors.shape)
print(vectors)
```

`vectors.shape` will be `(165,2)`
and vectors will be an array of 165 2D coordinates 
`[[-5,7],[-4,7],[-3,7],...,[5,7],[-5,6],...,[5,6],...,[5,-7]]`

----

`grid.index(x,y)`

Locates the index in the grid's coordinate array for the point (x,y)

Example:

```
import gridvoting
grid = gridVoting.Grid(x0=-5,x1=5,y0=-7,y=7)
idx = grid.index(x=-4,y=6)
print(idx)
```

`idx` will be 12, because `[-4,6]` is entry [12] of `grid.as_xy_vectors()`

----

`grid.spatial_utilities(voter_ideal_points, metric='sqeuclidean', scale=-1)`
