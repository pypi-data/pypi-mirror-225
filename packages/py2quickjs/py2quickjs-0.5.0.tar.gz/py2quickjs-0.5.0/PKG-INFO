Description: 
        Python wrapper around https://bellard.org/quickjs/ .
        
        Translates types like `str`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict` and combinations
        thereof to and from Javascript.
        
        QuickJS is currently thread-hostile, so this wrapper makes sure that all calls
        to the same JS runtime comes from the same thead.
