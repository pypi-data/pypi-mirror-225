# üå¥ PALM-E: A Multi-Modal AI Model 

This is the open source implementation of the SOTA multi-modality foundation model "PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model" from Google, PALM-E is a single large embodied multimodal model, that can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation üì¶

```sh
pip install palme
```

### Usage üé®

```python
import torch
from palme import PalmE

#usage
img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
caption_tokens = torch.randint(0, 4)

model = PalmE()
output = model(img, caption_tokens)

```
