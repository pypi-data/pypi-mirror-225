**cNMF-SNS** (consensus Non-negative Matrix Factorization Solution Network Space) is a Python package enabling mosaic integration of bulk, single-cell, and
spatial expression data between and within datasets. Datasets can have partially overlapping features (eg. genes) as well as non-overlapping features. cNMF provides a **robust, 
unsupervised** deconvolution of each dataset into gene expression programs (GEPs).
**Network-based integration** of GEPs enables flexible integration of many datasets
across assays (eg. Protein, RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, spatial expression) and patient cohorts.

Communities with GEPs from multiple datasets can be annotated with dataset-specific
annotations to facilitate interpretation.

## ‚ö°Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that cNMF-SNS does well:

- Identifies interpretable, non-negative programs at multiple resolutions
- Mosaic integration does not require subsetting features/genes to
  a shared or overdispersed subset
- Ideal for incremental integration (adding datasets one at a time) since
  deconvolution is performed independently on each dataset
- Integration performs well even when the datasets have mismatched features
  (eg. Microarray, RNA-Seq, Proteomics) or sparsity (eg single-cell vs bulk RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq)
- Two interfaces: command-line interface for rapid data exploration and python
  interface for extensibility and flexibility

## üîß Install

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Public Release

Install the package with conda (in an isolated conda environment)
```bash
conda create -n cnmfsns -c conda-forge cnmfsns
conda activate cnmfsns
```

## üìñ Documentation

### üóê Data guidelines

cNMF-SNS can factorize a wide variety of datasets, but will work optimally in these conditions:
  - Use untransformed (raw) data where possible, and avoid log-transformed data.
  - For single-cell or spatial RNA-Seq data, the best data to use is feature counts, then TPM-normalized values, then RPKM/FPKM-normalized values.

### üìì Python interface

To get started, sample proteomics datasets and a Jupyter notebook tutorial is available [here](/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).

Detailed API reference can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://cnmf-sns.readthedocs.io/).


### ‚å®Ô∏è Command line interface

See the [command line interface documentation](/CLI.md).
