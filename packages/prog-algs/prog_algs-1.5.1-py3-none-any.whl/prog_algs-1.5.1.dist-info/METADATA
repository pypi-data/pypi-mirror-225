Summary: The NASA Prognostics Algorithm Package is a framework for model-based prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering systems. It includes algorithms for state estimation and prediction, including uncertainty propagation. The algorithms use prognostic models (see prog_models) to perform estimation and prediction. The package enables rapid development of prognostics solutions for given models of components and systems. Algorithms can be swapped for comparative studies and evaluations

The Prognostic Algorithm Package is a python framework for model-based prognostics (computation of remaining useful life) of engineering systems, and provides a set of algorithms for state estimation and prediction, including uncertainty propagation. The algorithms take as inputs prognostic models (from NASA's Prognostics Model Package), and perform estimation and prediction functions. The library allows the rapid development of prognostics solutions for given models of components and systems. Different algorithms can be easily swapped to do comparative studies and evaluations of different algorithms to select the best for the application at hand.

This is designed to be used with the [Prognostics Models Package](https://github.com/nasa/prog_models).

## Acknowledgements
The structure and algorithms of this package are strongly inspired by the [MATLAB Prognostics Algorithm Library](https://github.com/nasa/PrognosticsAlgorithmLibrary) and the [MATLAB Prognostics Metrics Library](https://github.com/nasa/PrognosticsMetricsLibrary). We would like to recognize Matthew Daigle, Shankar Sankararaman and the rest of the team that contributed to the Prognostics Model Library for the contributions their work on the MATLAB library made to the design of prog_algs
