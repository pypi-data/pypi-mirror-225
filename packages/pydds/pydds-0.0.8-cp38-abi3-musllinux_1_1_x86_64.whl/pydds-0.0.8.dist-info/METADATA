# pydds
Replacement library for ImageMagick to decompress from many DDS pixel formats with an optional crop to a target region. While cropping can be done with separate libraries like Pillow doing it as part of decompression can save a lot of work as only the required blocks will be decompressed.

## Usage

`decode_dds` takes a blob of bytes and an optional cropping region, returning a PIL Image for further processing.

```python
from dds import decode_dds

# optional cropping region of (x0, y0, w, h) to be applied while decoding
crop = (0, 0, 20, 20)

with open('Atlas.dds', 'rb') as fh:
    img = decode_dds(fh.read(), crop)
```
