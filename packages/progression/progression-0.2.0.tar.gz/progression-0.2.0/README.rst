progression
===========

|PyPi version| |Build Status| |codecov|


An advanced progress bar in ASCII art which features
  * speed and estimated time of arrival
  * multiple bars
  * auto adjustment to the available terminal width
  * IPython notebook html output available

If you have one or more time consuming processes running and want to 
keep track of the current state, get an estimate on when the process 
is going to finish or if you just like statistics this package does the job.

|progExample|

It is pure python. It runs with python version 2 and 3. 
If you have IPython (and ipywidgets) installed and enable the widgets extension
an html variant of the ASCII art progress is available.
