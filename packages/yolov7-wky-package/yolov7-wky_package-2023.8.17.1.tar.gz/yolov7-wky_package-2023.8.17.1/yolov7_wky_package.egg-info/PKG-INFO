# YoloV7

A packaged version of the yolov7 implementation by Wong Kin Yiu:
https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

# Example usage

The package contains both `models` and `utils` as importable modules, using
`import models` and `import utils` respectively.

The scripts found in the root directory of the repository (such as `export.py`
and `train.py`) can be ran directly from the command line. To prevent naming
conflicts, they have been renamed to add 'yolov7_' at the beginning. For
example, `export.py` can be executed with the following command:

```shell
yolov7_export --weights yolov7.pt ...
```
