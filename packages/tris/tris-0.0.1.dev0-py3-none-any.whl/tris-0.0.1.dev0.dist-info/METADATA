This repository comprises the codebase for our paper, "An Automated Screening System for Trinary Star System Candidates",
that has been submitted to _Physica Scripta_.

Tris is an open-source tool that offers a specialized method to determine "observed-minus-computed" (OC) diagrams from 
astronomical flux time series data (lightcurves) obtained from NASA's Kepler and K2 missions.

Here is a brief outline of the algorithm:

Basic Guide to Codebase
-------------

[//]: # (- `data` - Contains the acquired `.fits` files that contain the light curves for all objects classified as EBs.)
- `datagen` - Contains the data generation and acquisition scheme to get the files in `data`.
- `docs` - Contains the documentation code for the codebase.
- `logbooks` - Personal Logbooks of us determining our ideal algorithm. It uses an older version of the codebase.
- `notebooks` - Notebooks to test our code and visualise them, and also to give examples of usage
- `pipelining` - Older versions of `datagen`.
- `src` and `utils` - Older versions of `tris`.
- `tris` - Currently contains (early-stage) versions of our improved library code that will later be deployed on PyPI.
- `manual_classification.xlsx` - Post Algorithm Manual Classification done by us.

Do note that in our codebase, you will see references to a `data/` folder. This folder contains the acquired `.fits` 
files that contain the light curves for all objects classified as EBs. You can install this by running 
`datagen/load.sh`.

Documentation

Setup
-------------

The `conda`, `pip` and `poetry` installation system is present in this repository.

TODO: Cleanup
-------------

This repo is currently being cleaned up to make way for a more organised library structure. The directories 
`pipelining`, `src`, `utils` will soon be removed. Hence, we would recommend not dealing with these directories or 
integrating them into your codebases.
