# SubReDo

Apply Cuts from a VideoReDo Project File to Subtitles.

[VideoReDo] allows you to make frame-accurate cuts without re-encoding the entire video or audio file. However, it does
not keep or cut Subtitles. That's where SubReDo comes in! Save your VideoReDo Project File (.Vprj) and pass it to
SubReDo, and it will apply the same cuts but on the Subtitle files.

> **Note**
> - Currently only SubRip (SRT) subtitles and Matroska Cut Exports are supported.<br/>

  [VideoReDo]: <https://www.videoredo.com>

## Features

- Automatically Muxes Subtitle Cuts to Video Cut Export
- Subtitle Flags and Metadata from Original Source are Retained

## Dependencies

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for cutting the Subtitles at specific calculated timestamps.
- [SubtitleEdit](https://nikse.dk/subtitleedit) for offsetting the Subtitle captions to sync up with the Cut video.

Please make sure `ffmpeg` and `SubtitleEdit` can be found on your `PATH` Environment Variable, in your Current
Working Directory, or in SubReDo's Installation directory.
