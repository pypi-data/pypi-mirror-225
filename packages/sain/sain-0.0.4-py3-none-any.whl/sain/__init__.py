"""Standard Rust core types implementations for Python.

Equavilant types
----------------
- `Option<T>` -> `sain.Option[T]` | `sain.Some[T]`
- `Result<T, E>` -> `sain.Result[T, E]`. Not implemented yet.
- `Default<T>` -> `sain.Default[T]`
- `AsRef<T>` -> `sain.Ref[T]`.
- `AsMut<T>` -> `sain.RefMut[T]`.
- `Iter<Item>` -> `sain.Iter[Item]`

Equavilant macros
-----------------
As decorators.

- `cfg!()` -> `sain.cfg`.
- `todo!()` -> `sain.todo`. This is not a decorator.
- `deprecated!()` -> `sain.deprecated`.
- `unimplemented!()` -> `sain.unimplemented`.
- `#[cfg_attr]` -> `sain.cfg_attr`.
