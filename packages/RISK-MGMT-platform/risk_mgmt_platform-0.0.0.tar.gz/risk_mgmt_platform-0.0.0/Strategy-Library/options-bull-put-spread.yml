description:
  short: Bullish credit spread strategy
  long: The Bull Put Spread is a bullish strategy that involves selling a put option (usually in-the-money or at-the-money) and buying another put option with a lower strike price but the same expiration date. This creates a credit upon entry, and the goal is to retain this credit as profit.

notes:
  - "Maximum profit is limited to the credit received upon entry."
  - "Maximum loss is the difference between the two strike prices minus the credit received."
  - "Profit is realized when the underlying asset stays above the strike price of the sold put through expiration."
  - "It benefits from time decay and a decrease in implied volatility."
