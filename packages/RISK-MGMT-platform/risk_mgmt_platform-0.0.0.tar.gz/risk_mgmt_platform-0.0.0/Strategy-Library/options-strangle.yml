notes:
  - "Profit potential is theoretically unlimited on the upside, while it is capped on the downside to the strike price of the put minus the combined premium paid."
  - "Maximum loss is limited to the combined premiums paid for both options."
  - "Profit is realized when there's a significant move in the underlying asset in either direction."
  - "Strategy benefits from a sharp move in the underlying asset's price and an increase in implied volatility."
