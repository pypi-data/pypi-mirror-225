Changes in Version 1.0.1:
- R: ComBat now accepts missing values. Note: our way of calculating feature variances (rows) differs from the SVA package. 
SVA: Variance denominator used when there is no missing values: n
SVA: Variance denominator used when there are missing values: m-1 (m=total number of non-missing values)
ComBatHarmonization: Variance denominator used when there is no missing values: n
ComBatHarmonization: Variance denominator used when there are missing values: m (m=total number of non-missing values)
By simulating missing values, we have shown that there is much more better agreement between the datasets.
