Effortlessly create and manage dummy Python packages.

The dummy_package_manager module offers a streamlined approach to generating
and handling dummy Python packages along with their optional dependencies.
This tool is designed to simplify testing, experimentation, and development
tasks that involve temporary package setups.

Key Features:
- Create temporary dummy packages with optional dependencies.
- Simplify the process of setting up isolated testing environments.
- Easily manage package installations and uninstallations.
- Designed for use in testing, experimentation, and development workflows.

## Installation

dummy_package_manager can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install dummy_package_manager

# to make sure you have the latest version
pip install -U dummy_package_manager

# latest available code base
pip install -U git+https://github.com/eftalgezer/dummy_package_manager.git
```

## Usage

You can use the `DummyPackage` class as a context manager to create and manage dummy packages. Here's an example:

```python
from dummy_package_manager import DummyPackage

with DummyPackage("my_package", requirements=["dependency1", "dependency2"]) as dummy_pkg:
    dummy_pkg.install()
    # Your code using the dummy package
    dummy_pkg.uninstall() # not necessary when exiting the context manager
```

## Unit Tests

dummy_package_manager comes with a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure its functionality. To run the tests, navigate to the main directory and execute:

```bash
pytest
```
