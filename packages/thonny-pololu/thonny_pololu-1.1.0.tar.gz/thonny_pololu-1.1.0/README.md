This plugin makes the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040
Robot](https://www.pololu.com/3pi) more usable with Thonny.  It's
mostly a copy of the built-in Pico plugin, but with "remote" files and
directories disabled, since they are unnecessary for our version of
MicroPython and can be confusing.

To install the plugin, open Thonny's "Tools" menu, click "Manage
plug-ins...", and search for "thonny-pololu".  You will need to
restart after installing.

To build the project, see [Packaging Python
Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
