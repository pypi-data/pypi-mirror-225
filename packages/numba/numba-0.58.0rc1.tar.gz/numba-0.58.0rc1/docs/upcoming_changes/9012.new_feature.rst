Added RVSDG-frontend
====================

This PR is a preliminary work on adding a RVSDG-frontend for processing 
bytecode. RVSDG (Regionalized Value-State Dependence Graph) allows us to
have a dataflow-centric view instead of a traditional SSA-CFG view. This
allows us to simplify the compiler in the future.
