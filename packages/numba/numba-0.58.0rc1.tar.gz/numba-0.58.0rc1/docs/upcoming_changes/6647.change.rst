Support for ``@numba.extending.intrinsic(prefer_literal=True)``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the high level extension API, the ``prefer_literal`` option is added to the
``numba.extending.intrinsic`` decorator to prioritize the use of literal types
when available. This has the same behavior as in the ``prefer_literal``
option in the ``numba.extending.overload`` decorator.
