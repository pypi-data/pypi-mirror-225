Add debuginfo support to nvdisasm output.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Support is added for debuginfo (source line and inlining information) in
functions that make calls through ``nvdisasm``. For example the CUDA dispatcher
``.inspect_sass`` method output is now augmented with this information.
