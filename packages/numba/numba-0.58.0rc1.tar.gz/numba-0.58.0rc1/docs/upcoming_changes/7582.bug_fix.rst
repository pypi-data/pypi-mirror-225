Prevent invalid fusion
""""""""""""""""""""""

This PR fixes an issue in which an array first read in a parfor and later
written in the same parfor would only be classified as used in the parfor.
When a subsequent parfor also used the same array then fusion of the
parfors was happening which should have been forbidden given that that the
first parfor was also writing to the array.  This PR treats such arrays
in a parfor as being both used and defined so that fusion will be prevented.
