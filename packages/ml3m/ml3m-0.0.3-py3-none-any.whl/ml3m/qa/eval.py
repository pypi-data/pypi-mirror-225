class QaOpenAIEvaluator(BaseOpenAIEvaluator):
    """Evaluator for question-answering via OpenAI.

    This evaluator utilizes the ability of OpenAI models to tell the quality of a
    response from the following aspects:

    - **Accuracy**: Using the reference answer as the ground truth, does the response
      include factually incorrect information?
    - **Completeness**: Compared with the reference answer, is the response missing
      details?
    - **Clarity**: Is the response well-organized and clearly presented? If accuracy
      and completeness is poor, clarity should also be considered poor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : str or pathlib.Path
        The absolute path to the evaluation dataset.
    save_path : str or pathlib.Path
        The absolute path to the save location. This path may or may not exist, and if
        it exists, its file contents will be treated as a (partially) written result.
        Whether to overwrite the existing results or to build on them depend on
        ``overwrite`` when using the :meth:`QaOpenAIEvaluator.evaluate` method.
    openai_config : str or pathlib.Path
        The absolute path to the OpenAI configuration file.
    info_func : Callable
        The function that extracts the question, actual answer, and expected answer of
        a data item. The input parameter should be a :class:`pandas.Series`, a list, or
        a dictionary, depending on ``fmt`` and the specific type of each data item. The
        output should be a tuple of three strings, respectively the question, the actual
        answer to that question, and the expected answer of that question. See the notes
        for examples.
    fmt : {"jsonl", "json", "csv"}, default="jsonl"
        The format of ``dataset``.
    aspects : list of {"accuracy", "completeness", "clarity"}, optional
        The aspects to evaluate. If ``None``, evaluate all available aspects.
    setting: str, optional
        The personality setting for the OpenAI model, passed as the system message. If
        ``None``, then no system message is used.
    n_iter : int, default=3
        The number of iterations for each data item. The mean of the scores for each
        data item will be taken as the final score.
    timeout : float, default=60
        The timeout in seconds. This is not the OpenAI timeout, but the timeout for
        cancelling the worker tasks.
    model : str, default="gpt-3.5-turbo"
        The ID of the model to use, must be one of the available OpenAI models that
        support the ChatCompletion API. See also
        https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility
    logging_mode : {"all", "failed", "none"}, default="all"
        The logging mode, whether to save the logs of all items, or only of failed
        items, or save no log.
    verbose : int, default=1
        The verbosity level of the processing. For level 0, only a progress bar will be
        displayed. For level 1, the errored items will also be displayed. For levels
        higher than 2, all items will be displayed.

    Notes
    -----
    Here are some examples of ``info_func``:

    Assume that ``dataset`` is in ``.jsonl`` format and each line is of the following
    form: ``{{"instruction": "xxx", "input": "xxx", "output": "xxx", "history": [],
    "response": "xxx"}}``. Then ``info_func`` can be defined as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        def info_func(data_item: dict) -> tuple[str, str, str]:
            question = data_item["instruction"] + "\\n" + data_item["input"]
            actual = data_item["response"]
            expected = data_item["output"]
            return question, actual, expected

    Now assume that ``dataset`` is in ``.csv`` format with columns "question",
    "answer", and "response". Then ``info_func`` can be defined as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        def info_func(data_item: pandas.Series) -> tuple[str, str, str]:
            question, answer, response = data_item[["question", "answer", "response"]]
