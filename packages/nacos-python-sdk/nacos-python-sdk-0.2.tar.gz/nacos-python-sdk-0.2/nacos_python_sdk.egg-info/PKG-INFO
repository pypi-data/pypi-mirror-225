# nacos-python-sdk
Our repository aligns with the [nacos-sdk-python](https://github.com/nacos-group/nacos-sdk-python/tree/master).

However, we have made modifications to the `client.py` file to incorporate authentication support for nacos versions 2.2 and above. This adjustment addresses the issue:
```
ERROR: nacos.client: [do-pulling] exception HTTP Error 403: occur, return an empty list, waiting for recovery.
```
Given that the original project is no longer maintained by its author and no pull requests have been accepted, we have taken the initiative to rectify and re-upload this project.
