# fajrGPT

---

This Python Command-Line application assists in helping you wake up for Fajr prayer by providing automatically selected verses + explanations from the Quran after a set alarm time along with a soothing Islamic prayer fade-in and fade-out from [Mishari bin Rashid Alafasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishari_bin_Rashid_Alafasy). The program uses the [Quran Module](https://github.com/UBISOFT-1/Quran_Module) to obtain Quran verses in English as well as OpenAI's API GPT models to produce corresponding Tafsir (explanation).

## Features

- Plays Alafsay's Quran recitation audio for user-selected Surah (default is Surah Al-Fathiha) from [Tahfeem](https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php)
- Includes option to play Alafsay's Quranic recitation with its corresponding English translation obtained from [The Chosen One](https://thechosenone.info/al-quran-with-english-translation/)
- Plays the downloaded audio after a user-specified countdown time (i.e. 10s, 15m, 7h), with volume gradually fading in.
- Option to select and display a Name of Allah and provide corresponding explanation of its meaning with the GPT API
- Displays automatically selected verses from the Quran and provides corresponding explanations.
- Depending on the length of the countdown, one, two, or three verses will be selected for display
- After each explanation, the program waits for the user to press Enter before proceeding.
- Once all explanations are provided, the audio volume gradually fades out over a 5-second period.
