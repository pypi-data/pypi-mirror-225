# Enphase-API - The unofficial Enphase® SDK for Python

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase®'s products and services.

This project is focusing primarily on the Enphase® "IQ Gateway" (formerly "IQ Envoy") system, the gateway for Enphase®'s IQ6, IQ7 and IQ8 Microinverters used on solar panels to convert Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) to be directly consumed by the home.

> **Warning**
> This project currently predominantly consumes the same local API that the local Gateway web administration portal consumes and Enphase® may choose to change it in subsequent updates without warning.

## Installing Enphase-API

Enphase-API is available on PyPI:

```console
$ python -m pip install Enphase_API
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the wrapper and the API itself is at [Enphase-API Documentation GitHub](https://github.com/Matthew1471/Enphase-API/blob/main/Documentation/README.adoc)
