.title Compiling to Assets

Compiling project resources into assets is done using the `assetc` command-line tool.

Upon invocation, it will scan the input folder and compile all resources in a supported format to the output folder. Files in an unsupported format are copied unmodified to the output folder.

*It is very important that you treat the compiled output folder as entirely disposable* and *only ever* perform modifications in the input folder. Output assets will be different for each platform you compile to.

Again, *do not ever work in the assets folder*.

If you are unclear on the resources/assets distinction see [man.Assets].

## Drag & drop

The easiest way is to drag and drop the resources folder on the assetc executable:

![assetc drag & drop](/images/docs/${HG_VERSION}/assetc.gif)

## Command-Line

Since HARFANG 3.2.5, `assetc` is now included in both _Python_ and _Lua_ versions.

### Python

In HARFANG Python 3.2.5 and above, `assetc` is packaged into the bdist wheel and can be invoked as a function of harfang.bin module.

In this example, we will compile a folder called `resources` and target the `OpenGL` API:

* From the command line:
   ```bash
   python3 -m harfang.bin assetc resources -api GL
   ```

* As a Python module:
   ```python
   import harfang.bin
   harfang.bin.assetc('resources', '-api', 'GL')
   ```

### Lua

In HARFANG Lua 3.2.5 and above, `assetc` is packaged along with the Lua extension and can be invoked as a function of harfang.bin.

In this example, we will compile a folder called `resources` and target the `OpenGL` API:

```lua
hg_bin = require "harfang.bin"
hg_bin.assetc('resources', '-api', 'GL')
```

## Usage in detail

If you need more control over the compilation options, the command line gets the following parameters:

```
assetc <input> [output PATH] [-daemon] [-platform PLATFORM] [-api API] [-defines DEFINES] [-job COUNT]
       [-toolchain PATH] [-progress] [-log_to_std_out] [-debug] [-quiet] [-verbose]
```

Option | Shortcut | Description
-------|----------|------------
`-input` | | Input project resources folder.
`-output` | | Output compiled assets folder. If unspecified, the input folder path suffixed with `_compiled` is used.
`-daemon` | `-d` | Run the compiler in daemon mode. The compiler will constantly monitor the input folder and compile its content as it is modified.
`-platform` | `-p` | Platform to target.
`-api` | | Graphics API to target. Some platforms (eg. PC) might support multiple graphics API (DX11, DX12, GL, ...).
`-defines` | `-D` | Semicolon separated defines to pass to the shader compiler (eg. FLAG;VALUE=2).
`-job` | `-j` | Maximum number of parallel job (0 - automatic).
`-toolchain` | `-t` | Path to the toolchain folder.
`-progress` | | Output progress to the standard output.
`-log_to_std_out` | `-l` | Log errors to the standard output.
`-debug` | | Compile in debug mode (eg. output debug informations in shader).
`-quiet` | `-q` | Disable all build information but errors.
`-verbose` | `-v` | Output additional information about the compilation process.

*Note:* When run in daemon mode `assetc` will not exit after its initial run and will keep watching the input folder. When a resource is modified it will automatically be compiled to the output folder.

See [man.GLTF] and [man.FBX] to convert common 3d formats to Harfang resources.
