# Documentation

# Running Tests

We use pytest for our testing framework. To run the tests, you can run the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

To set up in VS Code for debugging, you can add the following to your launch.json file under "configurations". This will allow you to go into "Run and Debug" and run the tests from there, with breakpoints and everything.

NOTE: You may need to change args to the path of your tests folder.

```json
{
    "name": "Python: Pytest",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "pytest",
    "args": [
        "lumibot/tests"
    ],
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
}
```

Here's an example of an actual launch.json file:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Pytest",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "pytest",
            "args": [
                "lumibot/tests"
            ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
        }
    ]
}
```
