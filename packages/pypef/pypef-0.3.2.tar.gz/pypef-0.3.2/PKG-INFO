Summary: A command-line interface (CLI) tool for performing data-driven protein engineering by building machine learning (ML)-trained regression models from sequence variant fitness data (in CSV format) based on different techniques for protein sequence encoding. Next to building pure ML models, 'hybrid modeling' is also possible using a blended model optimized for predictive contributions of a statistical and an ML-based prediction.
